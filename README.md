Description
------------------------------------------
This project allows a user to input the path to a photo of their hand, preferably against a surface that is different
from your skin tone, to determine the shape and location of their hand. The shape can either be a fist, "karate chop", or
a splayed five. The hand's location can also be in the upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right, or undecided
portion of the image's window.

Prerequisites
------------------------------------------
To run this code, you must install the OpenCV module in your terminal as such

"pip install opencv-python"
